## Breakdown of Group Member Contributions

For this project, each team member was assigned a single area to research, develop, and implement. Paige Lavin took the lead on creating timelapse videos of all the case study lakes using Google Earth Engine. Marta Wolfshorndl took charge of producing time series charts of median pixel values for all of the case lake studies using Google Earth Engine and Observable Notebooks and D3, as well the summary figures, also made in Observable Notebooks and using D3. Carley Fredrickson handled the development of the project page and application toolkit using Javascript and HTML. Paige Lavin designed the poster and all group members contributed to writing the project paper and supporting documentation.

## Project Process Commentary

We started this project by meeting with our project sponsor and collaborator Catherine Kuhn. We wanted clarifications on what she needed as a deliverable from us, as well as what tools and data she wanted us to use. At this meeting, we learned about Google Earth Engine and what researchers in her area look for. After this meeting, we decided to divide our work based on individual areas of our project: the timelapse videos, the satellite channel pixel intensity time series plots, and the application design. Throughout the following weeks, we would touch base with each other on our progress, both through email and in person.

Before our design review session, we had one interaction encoded on our toolkit where a selection of a square marker on a zoomable and pannable image of our region would generate still images of the time series charts and a gif of a river timelapse. The TAs suggested that we use Leaflet to create our interactive map, that we use videos instead of gifs, and that we implement an interaction to facilitate comparisons between different lakes. That week, we all put in the hours to make these suggestions a reality. 

We had one additional meeting with our collaborator to check with her about whether the design so far would fully meet her needs, and from that meeting concluded that adding summary figures would help quickly orient the viewer or researcher to the dataset. 

We think our project strategy worked well, as each group member didnâ€™t rely on the progress of others. The frequent in person meetings were also critical to our success.
